# This file defines which tests will be run by sysverify for this system the
# syntax is simple, either put the exact script name as contained with the test
# directory, this can include a path. Example /mysql/verify-tables.sh would
# run the script ./test/mysql/verify-tables.sh If you would like it to run an
# entire directory use the * symbol, for example /mysql/* would run all test in
# ./test/mysql
/example/*
